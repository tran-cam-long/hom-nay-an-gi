# Frontend demo

This is a minimal, unbundled React demo page. It uses React and ReactDOM from a CDN so you can open the page in a browser without building.

To view:

1. Save the cat background image attachment as `frontend/bg-cats.png` (exact filename).
2. Open `frontend/index.html` in a browser (double-click or `open`/`xdg-open`).

Notes:
- This demo uses Babel in the browser for convenience — it's fine for prototyping only, not production.
- If you want, I can convert this to a Vite/CRA project and wire the aggregator endpoint.
